I am currently working on four main projects:

1.  Maintaining and updating the [AIscreenR package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AIscreenR/index.html). We are currently working on adding new functions to ease the fine-tuning of models and making a report function that simplifies the user's ability to compare disagreements between humans and the model.

2.  Finalizing the analyses and writing of a systematic review regarding the effects of interventions on the economic self-sufficiency of unemployed immigrants from non-Western countries [(Thuesen et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1115).

3.  Investigating the effects of extended school days on student achievement, well-being, and behavioral outcomes

4.  Investigating the longitudinal effects of developmental and educational RCTs. For more details see [https://osf.io/jh4e2/](https://osf.io/jh4e2/).
