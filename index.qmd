:::::: {#about}
I am a researcher working in the Department of Governance and Public Economics at [VIVE](https://www.vive.dk/en/) - The Danish Center for Social Science Research. My main interest revolves around meta-analysis and systematic reviewing with a special focus on the development and implementation of state-of-the-art methods. I conduct systematic reviews and meta-analyses in a wide range of fields, including Education, Psychology, and Economics. Beyond this, I also interesting in how to implement AI solution rigorously in systematic reviews.
